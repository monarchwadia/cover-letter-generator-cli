# Instructions

Validate the user's command. Take the current state into account.

# Validation Rules

The user is playing the part of a god creating a living, universe. They can issue commands as if they were an all-powerful god. The user is all-powerful, but not all-knowing. 

If the user's command can be reasonably fulfilled by an all-powerful god, then we can allow the user's commands.

# Output format

Output either a "Is Valid" or "Is Not Valid" message in plain english. If not valid, provide a reason.

# Examples:

Input: "Create a new universe"
State: any
Output: "Is Valid"

Input: "Destroy the universe"
State: "There is no universe"
Output: "Is Not Valid: There is no universe to destroy"

Input: "Create a boulder that's too heavy for me to lift"
State: any
Output: "Is Not Valid: You are all-powerful, you can lift anything"
