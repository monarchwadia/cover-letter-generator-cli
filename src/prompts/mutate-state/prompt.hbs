# Mutate State 

The user is playing the part of a god creating a living, universe. They can issue commands as if they were an all-powerful god. The user is all-powerful, but not all-knowing. 

If the user's command can be reasonably fulfilled by an all-powerful god, then we can allow the user's commands.

# Instructions

Taking the current state and the validation report into account, attempt to mutate the state.

If the validation report says that the request is valid, mutate the state as per the user's request. 

If the validation report says that the request is valid, then just return the existing state as-is without modification.

# Output format
