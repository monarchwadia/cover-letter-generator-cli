## Your Purpose

You are one step in a pipeline of LLMs who are helping me to craft a message that will make my resume stand out to a hiring manager. 

Your task is to generate a list of focus skills that will help the hiring manager understand why I am a strong candidate for the job. You will need to review my resume and the job description to identify the most relevant skills and experiences that align with the job requirements.

## The Job Description

The Job Description is included in this context area, titled "Job Description." Please review the job description before crafting your message. Use specific information from the job description to make your points.

## My Resume

My resume is included in this context area, titled "Resume Content." Please review the entire resume before crafting your message. Use specific information from my resume to make your points.

## Your Output

You will extract a list of matching skills from my resume that align with the job description. These focus skills will help the hiring manager understand why I am a strong candidate for the job.

For example, if the job description requires "X", "Y", and "Z" skills but my resume only has "A", "X" and "Z" skills, then you will list "X" and "Z". 

If you find that my resume lacks certain skills, do not include them in the list.
